Built with [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/). Not affiliated with gmail . This is **NOT** an official product. Read the [DISCLAIMER](https://github.com/ankursmooth/Gmail-for-Desktop/blob/master/DISCLAIMER).\r\n\r\nthe major work of this project is done by @Aluxian \r\n\r\n\r\ni have modified it to show desktop notifications for gmail\r\n\r\nwhen notification comes, to check that email, click on the gmail icon in notification area\r\n\r\n## *gmail* features\r\n\r\n* Group chats\r\n* Send photos & videos\r\n* Share locations\r\n\r\n## *Unofficial gmail for Desktop* features\r\n\r\n* Badge with the number of notifications in the dock/taskbar (OS X and Windows)\r\n* Auto-launch on OS startup (OS X, Windows)\r\n* Native notifications (all platforms)l\r\n* System tray icon (OS X, Windows)\r\n* Open links in browser or new window\r\n* Preferences in the right-click context menu (or menu bar for OS X, tray menu for Windows)\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\n### Pre-requisites\r\n\r\n    # install gulp\r\n    npm install -g gulp\r\n\r\n    # install dependencies\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n* **wine**: If you're on OS X/Linux and want to build for Windows, you need [Wine](http://winehq.org/) installed. Wine is required in order\r\nto set the correct icon for the exe. If you don't have Wine, you can comment out the `winIco` field in `gulpfile`.\r\n* **makensis**: Required by the `pack:win32` task in `gulpfile` to create the Windows installer.\r\n* [**fpm**](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm): Required by the `pack:linux{32|64}:deb` tasks in `gulpfile` to create the Linux installers.\r\n\r\nQuick install on OS X:\r\n\r\n    brew install wine makensis\r\n    sudo gem install fpm\r\n\r\n### OS X: pack the app in a .dmg\r\n\r\n    gulp pack:osx64\r\n\r\n### Windows: create the installer\r\n\r\n    gulp pack:win32\r\n\r\n### Linux 32/64-bit: pack the app in a .deb\r\n\r\n    gulp pack:linux{32|64}:deb\r\n\r\nThe output is in `./dist`. Take a look at `gulpfile.coffee` for additional tasks.\r\n\r\n**TIP**: use the `--toolbar` parameter to quickly build the app with the toolbar on. E.g. `gulp build:win32 --toolbar`.\r\n\r\n**TIP**: use `gulp build:win32 --noicon` to quickly build the Windows app without the icon.\r\n\r\n**TIP**: for OS X, use the `run:osx64` task to build the app and run it immediately.\r\n\r\n## Note to gmail\r\n\r\nThis project does not attempt to reverse engineer the gmail API or attempt to reimplement any part of the gmail client. Any communication between the user and gmail servers is handled by gmail Web itself; this is just a native wrapper for gmail Web, more akin to a browser than any gmail software.\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\n\r\nContributions are welcome!
