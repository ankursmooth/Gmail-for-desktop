This project does not attempt to reverse engineer the Gmail API or
attempt to reimplement any part of the Gmail client. Any communication
between the user and gmail servers is handled by gmail itself;
this is just a native wrapper for gmail Website, more akin to a browser
than any gmail software.

The Gmail logo, the Gmail brand colour and the images used in the
are owned by gmail / google .
